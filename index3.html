    <h2 class = "subtitles">Education and Career</h2>
    <p class = "text">At an early age, Thomas H. Flowers attended a technical college on a scholarship until he was 16. In 1921, Tommy Flowers was partaking as an apprentice in mechanical engineering at Royal Arsenal, Woolwich for 4 years. At the same time, he took evening classes at the University of London to help him earn a degree in electrical engineering. After his education, he joined the Post Office as an electrical engineer in 1926 and later on moved to the Post Office Research Station in 1930.</p>

    <h2 class = "subtitles">Contribution to the History of Computer Programming</h2>
    <p class = "text">Tommy Flowers is known to have created the first programmable electronic computer. In 1943, Tommy Flowers helped Max Newman build the Lorenz SZ machine which was used to decode secret communications between Adolf Hitler and his generals in WWII. Flowers explained the goal of Newman's machine, <q>The purpose was to find out what the positions of the code wheels were at the beginning of the message and it did that by trying all the possible combinations and there were billions of them. It tried all the combinations, which processing at 5,000 characters a second could be done in about half an hour. So then having found the starting positions of the cipher wheels you could decode the message.</q> Though Newman's machine kept breaking down, Tommy Flowers decided to continue the project. It was only after February 1944 that the machine became successful and was called Colossus Mark I. In the same year, he and Max Newman created a second machine similar to the first, but much more efficient. It was called the Colossus Mark II.</p>
